# CSCE636-Project-Coughing-Detection
## **Project_8**
### Instruction:
1. Download the code and processed videos(skeleton frames) [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kl-m7NP0o1YKvBPQXbD86HMU4Hg4WCQp/view?usp=sharing).  
2. Open the [Cough_detection_final2(execution).ipynb](https://github.com/CherryXChen/CSCE636-Project-Coughing-Detection/blob/master/Project_8/Cough_detection_final2(execution).ipynb) in Jupyter.  
3. Replace path to the folder you want to test.  
i.e. ![image](https://github.com/CherryXChen/CSCE636-Project-Coughing-Detection/blob/master/Pictures/path_replace.png)  
(Since the data I used is special, you need to use openpose to generate the skeleton figures with black background. I have generated them for each video and saved in corresponding folder.)
i.e. ![image](https://github.com/CherryXChen/CSCE636-Project-Coughing-Detection/blob/master/Pictures/figure_folder.jpg)
4. Run the code.
